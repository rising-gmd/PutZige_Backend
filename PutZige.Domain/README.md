# PutZige.Domain

Core domain layer of the solution.

## Contains
- `Entities/` – domain entities and value objects
- `Interfaces/` – domain-level contracts
- `Enums/` – domain enumerations

## Guidelines
- No direct dependencies on infrastructure or UI
- Keep business rules and invariants here
- Prefer rich domain models over anemic ones
